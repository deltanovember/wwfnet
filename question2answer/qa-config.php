	Some settings to help optimize your QA site's performance.
	
	If QA_HTML_COMPRESSION is true, HTML web pages will be output using Gzip compression, if
	the user's browser indicates this is supported. This will increase the performance of your
	site, but will make debugging harder if PHP does not complete execution.
	
	QA_MAX_LIMIT_START is the maximum start parameter that can be requested. As this gets
	higher, queries tend to get slower, since MySQL must examine more information. Very high
	start numbers will usually only requested by search engine robots anyway.
	
	If a title word or tag is used QA_IGNORED_WORDS_FREQ times or more, it is ignored when
	searching or finding related questions. This saves time by ignoring words which are so
	common that they are probably not worth matching on.

	Set QA_OPTIMIZE_LOCAL_DB to true if your web server and MySQL are running on the same box.
	When viewing a page on your site, this will use several simple MySQL queries instead of one
	complex one, which makes sense since there is no latency for localhost access.
	
	Set QA_PERSISTENT_CONN_DB to true to use persistent database connections. Only use this if
	you are absolutely sure it is a good idea under your setup - generally it is not.
	For more information: http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.persistent-connections.php
	
	Set QA_DEBUG_PERFORMANCE to true to show detailed performance profiling information.

	file to override the default setting. Just make sure you know what you're doing!
